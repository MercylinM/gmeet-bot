# gmeet-bot

This project records and transcribes using Google Cloud Speech to Text a google meet meeting from a container with a audio and video using virtual sound card (pulseaudio) and screen recording with Xscreen.

One of the main challenge is to record the session without a sound card using audio loop sink and not being flagged by the meeting provider (in this case google meet).

```
docker build -t gmeet -f Dockerfile .
